biodata
=======

BioData is a Java library that models biological entities and their equivalents in different file formats typically used in bioinformatics.

Its aim is to keep applications as agnostic as possible from the file formats they receive as input. This way, analysis can be conducted on
data retrieved from very different files. In the context of variant analysis, those could be the VCF and GVF formats.

At the same time, information must not be lost, so the Java models are flexible enough to store any fields specific to a certain format.
